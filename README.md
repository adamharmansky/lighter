# Lighter

a simple gtk+3 application to set your brightness

Sort of suckless, except that it's gtk so yeah. it's just a little application I've made to see if it's worth it to get into gtk

## DEPENDENCIES

 - `light` - install and reboot, this allows you to set you backlight without root privilleges
 - `gtk+3-devel` or whatever you call it on ubuntu - idk I use void :sunglasses:
